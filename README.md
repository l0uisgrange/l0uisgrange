### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸš§ The project I'm currently working on is named [Spice](https://github.com/l0uisgrange/spice). It's a next-generation circuit simulator for MacOS, with a quick engine, using SwiftUI and Metal. I'm looking to release it soon.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SwiftUI, and I'm also investigating circuit simulation engines.
- ðŸ˜„ My pronouns are he/him.
